A polynomial is a sum of monomials with a single variable, x.
Each polynomial is represented by an object in the Polynomial class.
Each object of type Polynomial has its maximum degree defined.

A fraction (an object in the Rational class) is represented by two polynomials - the denominator and the numerator.

Write the classes Polynomial and Rational so that the output of the main program, obtained after running the Main.cpp file, will be identical to the output shown in the attached file results.jpg.

Additional requirements:
Avoid code duplication and unnecessary code.
Use const and references wherever appropriate.
Do not use a class of type Monomial. The Polynomial class does not contain any objects belonging to other classes.
Additionally, the Polynomial class will store the maximum degree of each polynomial defined. This value can be printed at any given time.
